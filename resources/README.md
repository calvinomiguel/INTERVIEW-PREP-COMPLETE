#### Make your name **BIG.** <a href="#make-your-name-big" id="make-your-name-big"></a>

Your name has to stand out from everything else, because you want it to be remembered. Making it the biggest thing on the page is the easiest thing you can do to make that possible. I've seen soooo many resumes where the name is at the top, but it's just bolded and centered and they expect that to be enough. It's not.

#### Remove the objective. <a href="#remove-the-objective" id="remove-the-objective"></a>

Nobody looks at the objective. Nobody. I personally spoke to a bunch of recruiters from various companies and they all said that they never look at them. Use that space to talk about projects you've done, activities you've done, etc.

#### Keep it to a single page. <a href="#keep-it-to-a-single-page" id="keep-it-to-a-single-page"></a>

Recruiters are looking for a short summary of you. They're reading several resumes a day, and if they see something longer than they typically read, they could pass over yours for something more concise! If you'd like to say more, put a link to a personal website or portfolio for someone to find it. A resume is a summary, not a tome.

#### Remove irrelevant information. <a href="#remove-irrelevant-information" id="remove-irrelevant-information"></a>

I know that lifeguarding in high school was a good gig that helped you gain people skills and attention to detail. But you're in tech. That doesn't matter as much to tech companies. Sorry, buddy. I still think you're great with people.\
When you're a first semester freshman, it's okay to have old high school stuff on there, just because it's less likely that you have other things to put on your resume. But as soon as you have a college GPA to work with, a club or two, and some volunteer experiences to replace that, do it.

#### Don't make it a scavenger hunt. <a href="#dont-make-it-a-scavenger-hunt" id="dont-make-it-a-scavenger-hunt"></a>

When an application reviewer (engineer, recruiter, or otherwise) is looking over your resume, don't make it difficult for them to understand who you are and what you know.

For example, if you have online profiles like GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, or even your own personal website, put it on your resume. Don't make them have to search long and hard for you online if they want to know more!

If you decide to put relevant coursework on your resume, **please**, don't just put course numbers. Nobody knows what that means. And nobody is going to go to your university's website to find out exactly what CS229 is. Put down the course titles instead!

And finally, put down your graduation date. So many students I've seen don't put it on there because they are hiding the fact that they're a freshman, or they're "technically a junior if you count the credits." That doesn't matter. Trust me. Just put down your graduation date so that the company knows how much experience you have, and how soon they can potentially pull you in for full-time.

#### Include only certain personal information. <a href="#include-only-certain-personal-information" id="include-only-certain-personal-information"></a>

Companies aren't allowed to ask about your religion, marital status, or race/ethnicity, so you shouldn't include that.

In terms of contact information: you don't need your mailing address. That is a thing of the past. Just like my youth. Tech companies email, and **maybe** call. That's all you need!\
Some great things that you might also want to put on there are your personal website (if you have one, which you should), your GitHub profile (if you have one, which you should), and your LinkedIn (if you have one, which you should).

## CV SAMPLE <a href="#cv-sample" id="cv-sample"></a>

Your cover letter is your written sales pitch. You've got a resume that summarizes everything. Now you have to write out a more complete, professional description of you and what you can offer a given company. Here's a sample cover letter to get you started:

> Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,
>
> I hope your day is going well! My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and I'm a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. I am very interested in working for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ next \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Your commitment to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that I saw on the website inspired me! The products you build and the values you stand for make \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ seem like an ideal workplace for me. A little about me, I \[insert relevant work experience, extracurriculars, and projects here]. I think these experiences would make me a great candidate for you.\
> Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me. I look forward to hearing from you! I can be reached at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
> Best regards,
>
> ***

Now, remember, this is just a sample. You can write a cover letter in any format you'd like. But, you should be sure to include the following:

* **Who** - Who you are. Easy enough.
* **Where** - Where you're coming from.
* **Why** - Why you're interested in this company, and show that you researched them.
* **What** - What you can bring to the table.
* **When** - When you're available to start, and when they can contact you.
* **How** - How they can reach you.

## YOUR ATTITUDE <a href="#your-attitude" id="your-attitude"></a>

When you're internship/job hunting, it's very easy to feel down if you don't hear back from companies, an interview goes poorly, or you start comparing yourself to people. It's a tough field we're going into.

I want to emphasize something: **You're brilliant.** You're in this field for a reason. When your grades aren't awesome or someone gets something that you wanted, don't feel down on yourself. So many opportunities will come your way if you just keep working hard and refining your skills.

Mark Twain once said, "Comparison is the death of joy." When you start to compare your skills to others, it's hard to not feel as good about your own, or to get a little too competitive about your work. Work hard and don't let others get you down. It's remarkable how significantly that can improve both your work and your interviewing experience!

When you're talking to companies and recruiters at career fairs and hackathons and over the phone, be confident, not arrogant. Be grateful for the opportunity they're giving you, and smile! A great attitude will take you VERY far.

## YOUR SKILLS <a href="#your-skills" id="your-skills"></a>

Obviously, your skills are what a company is buying from you when they hire you. So, honing in those skills and presenting them in an effective way is _probably_ the most important thing in getting a gig.

### Building Them <a href="#building-them" id="building-them"></a>

Chances are, if you've had a data structures and/or algorithms class, you're already going to do pretty well in the technical interviews. That is, if you can recall the information you learned.

Here's a checklist of things that you should probably be prepared to know in a technical interview:

* Data types
* Basic Bitwise Operations
* String Operations
* Arrays
* Linked Lists
  * Singly Linked
  * Doubly Linked
  * Circular Linked
* Queues
* Stacks
* Heaps
* Trees
  * Binary Trees
  * Binary Search Trees
  * Tries
  * Self Balancing Trees
* Traversing Trees
  * Breadth First Search - BFS
  * Depth First Search - DFS
  * Preorder, Inorder, Postorder
* Graphs
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm / A\* Search
* Hash Maps
  * Handling Collisions
* Sorting algorithms
  * Insertion
  * Selection
  * Merge
  * Quick
* Time Complexities

This guide isn't for teaching you these skills. But there are several guides, problem sets, and practice systems out there that can help.

Typically, for an internship or your first job, questions won't get much more specific unless you're applying for a specific role. For example, if I wanted to be a mobile intern, I might be asked iOS/Android/Windows Phone specific questions, or if I wanted to be a web intern, I might be asked HTML/CSS/JavaScript questions, or if I wanted to be a backend intern, I might be asked about Django or Node or Ruby on Rails. That definitely depends on the company, and what you're both looking for.

Make sure you're able to implement and use the above data structures without the assistance of an IDE. Typically, onsite technical interviews involve coding on paper or a whiteboard, and phone/video interviews usually involve some kind of collaborative text editor. Yes, that means you won't have access to auto-complete, auto-compiling, or the internet to check for errors. So be ready for that!

### Selling Them <a href="#selling-them" id="selling-them"></a>

When you're actively emailing and speaking with recruiters, they're going to ask you a lot of questions that are just checkboxes for what they're looking for in terms of skills.

If you've written anything in a language before, **put it on your resume**. A lot of companies have parsers that look for specific things that, again, will put a tick on those checkboxes before putting you through to the next round of review. Now, if you've only ever done "Hello, world!" in Python, don't say that you're a Python ninja or whatever. You don't want to be thrown into an interview that will only hurt your self-confidence. Speaking from experience. Trust me.

When a recruiter or engineer is asking you about a certain project you've done, or how you've used a particular language, be as specific as possible. Tell them **exactly** what you did on that particular project (or internship or what have you). Tell them how much you contributed, what languages you used, how long was the duration of development for that project, what was the outcome of the project, etc. etc.

For example, don't say, "I'm the webmaster for a club website. Next question." Okay, Dwight Schrute. Go back to your beet farm. Instead, say something more like this: "I developed and currently maintain the website for my university's computer science club. I built it from the ground up with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery on the front-end. It's a static site, so a backend wasn't needed. The website's main function is to promote the club and give members crucial updates about meetings and events, and I update it regularly via a Python script I wrote." Oh my, you enchanting software engineer, you. Let me hire you.

When you're talking to companies about specific things you've done, make sure they know:

* **What?** - What? - What did you make? What does it do? What impact has it made? What was the hardest part? What could you have done better?
* **Why?** - Why did you make it? Was it for a hackathon, a school project, an open source contribution, or something else?
* **How?** - With which technologies did you make this? Did you use a specific API? What parts of it did you work on?
* **When?** - Did you do this recently or are you still living off of when you peaked in 10th grade?
* **Who?** - Did you work on this with anyone? Who did what? Who is this for?

## Getting Started in Job Search

🔑Outreach is the key difference in getting a job in 3 months vs. 8 months, which **equates to roughly $21,000 in salary**! (Source: Recently hired graduate data).

**To set yourself up for success in Job Search, do the following immediately:**

* **Ensure your** [**Your Student Profile**](https://dashboards.lambdaschool.com/profile) **is complete with**
  * Update your technical skills, preferred roles and location preferences.
  * Update links to your resume, Github, and LinkedIn
  * Indicate interest in Fellows and [Public Profiles](https://profiles.lambdaschool.com) - do this by answering the questions under "Job Preferences". More details on Public Profiles [here](https://www.notion.so/8f9f48f690fc453fb8b50d9183aef634).
* **Take the Codesignal GCA if you don't have a score of 650+**

[🔑Your First Month Guide to Success](https://www.notion.so/Your-First-Month-Guide-to-Success-d53f2d27c6e84f38a97727dc8a25474c)

* **Attend the Welcome to the Job Search live session** on Week 1 of your Job Search
* **Send at least 10 customized outreach emails to at least 10 employer contacts** (more on how this works below)
* **Apply to 10 jobs every week** and log it using [Job Tracker](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/jobtracker)
* \*\*Complete the Job Search Onboarding Canvas Course. \*\*This course will teach you everything from how to apply, do outreach, prep for an interview and much more! ([Link to course](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/enroll/BTEYHF))
* **Achieve a 650+ on the CodeSignal GCA**, if you haven't already ([link to test](https://app.codesignal.com/signup?certifiedInvite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX))
* **Green Github** 15+ days of the month or complete 10+ code challenges
* \*\*Secure 1 interview in your first 30 days of job searching. \*\*Graduates with 1 interview in the first 30 days are 3x more likely to get a job in 90 days. This interview doesn't have to be at your dream company, in fact, it is better if it isn't. If you only work toward one goal, let it be this!

From working with 1000s of placed Lambda graduates, we know that outreach is the key to landing that first interview. To speed things along, I will be providing email contacts and outreach messages for jobs you apply to. The following [tutorial video](https://www.notion.so/5983de693024407f888d9b8e3694f3f5) will run you through how this simple process works:

To take advantage of this, fill out the\*\* \*\*[**Outreach Request Form**](https://airtable.com/shrDZgl0o92rMugIh) with a link to a job description and some quick reasons on why you are a good fit. Our team will send you the email address and a customized 3-email sequence outreach to send. The form should take you <5 minutes to fill out and once you submit it you will get the outreach document within 1-2 business days.

🥗 Food for thought: If you spend 1-2 hours finding 10 job openings you are interested in and 1 hour filling out an [**Outreach Request Form**](https://airtable.com/shrDZgl0o92rMugIh) for each job opportunity, and 20 minutes sending the outreach messages, you will complete your expected weekly outreach goal in under 4 hours! ⏰
